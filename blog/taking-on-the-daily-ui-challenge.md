## The Why

After some time experimenting with tutorials on youtube about ui design, i realized that the best approach to become a better desinger is to actually build stuff on your own. I randomly ran across the Daily UI Challenge and i decided to give it a go, sharing my process along the way. 

## The How

My current role at the company i work, is designing and implementing user interfaces. Whether it is a new screen for an existing project or a entirely new website.
Therefore, i must figure out a simple and intuitive interface to communicate with the user. In this series of posts i will guide you through that process sharing my thoughts about my design decisions.

## The What

My goal is to construct those interfaces in the browser and not just upload the desing as an image. I am also responsible to build this thing, remember? 

I won't go into further details, let's get started!
