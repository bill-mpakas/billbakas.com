# Introducing 

Hi! I'm your first Markdown file in **StackEdit**. If you want to learn about StackEdit, you can read me. If you want to play with Markdown, you can edit me. Once you have finished with me, you can create new files by opening the **file explorer** on the left corner of the navigation bar.

   ```html
<div class="flex justify-start bg-gray-200">
 <div class="text-gray-700 text-center bg-gray-400 px-4 py-2 m-2">1</div>
  <div class="text-gray-700 text-center bg-gray-400 px-4 py-2 m-2">2</div>
  <div class="text-gray-700 text-center bg-gray-400 px-4 py-2 m-2">3</div>
</div>
```

```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```
 
```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```
 
```
No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting. 
But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.
